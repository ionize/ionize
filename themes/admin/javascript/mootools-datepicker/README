Mootools 1.3 Datepicker class
=============================
Fork from the original monkeyphisics awesome datepicker class

The script is almost unchanged in its interfaces, but is compatible with the new release of mootools 1.3
The wrong year selection when clicking a day in the previous/next year part of a month view is fixed.
Added the getMaxZindex method in order to show the calendar even above layers.
