  <h2>MP3/audio: Wobbler - Sanxion (bazillion edit)</h2>

  <h2>GIFs (animated and still)</h2><img src="smilies.gif" style=
  "display: block; float: right;">

  <p>Origins: unknown.</p>

  <p>The 'rant_yellow' GIF is a pretty animated gif (<img src=
  "rant_yellow.gif">), both ways; the <img src="sad2.gif"> 'sad' GIF is another
  animated one which was used to trigger thumbnailing bugs where tiny images
  would be enlarged, either by PHP/GD or by incorrect HTML codes when rendering
  the image in the gallery pane or elsewhere, while the 'smilies' GIF should be
  just large enough to trigger the thumbnailing for 250px
  thumbnails.</p><img src="txtmovementvh8.gif">

  <p>Origin: <a href=
  "http://carocat.co.uk/2006/12/07/save-the-vowels-my-view/">Save the Vowels</a></p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the 'txt movement' (animated) GIF should do the same (trigger
  the thumbnailer) due to being too wide &emdash; though there once was a
  time in mootools-filemanager when this one would be resized for a thumbnail,
  while landscape formats (e.g. 'smilies') would not.</p>

  <p>License: all these images are explicitly placed in the public domain and
  are free from copyright.</p>

  <p>The images are available in a subdirectory.</p>

  <h3>WARNING</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>the images in the subdirectory are <strong>not the original
      images</strong>: they have been tweaked to reduce their filesize from
      anywhere between a factor of 1.2 and 10; their filenames have the
      photographer (when known) listed between braces and otherwise the file
      name may have been edited to trigger a certain type of behaviour /
      failure that occurred in mootools-filemanager at one time or another.</p>

      <p>You may find that some of them have been denoised rather agressively,
      but I don't expect such artifacts to show up at viewing sizes at or below
      HD (1920x1200), at least not for the larger images.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>several images have large dimensions and PHP/GD would have crahed
      processing them. Now you get to see the 'oversized' icon instead.
      Clicking on the icon in the detail pane will nevertheless pop up the
      milkbox, which will show you the 'original' image.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>one or more of the images are available in another subdirectory,
      titled 'you may encounter possible long file name issues in here!'.
      There, images with very long filenames reside; these may trigger faults
      due to path length limitations when moving and/or re-uploading them.</p>

      <p>Indeed, you might want to pick these images and use them to test
      upload behaviour / performance too, when you have them available locally
      as well. As these include several very large dimension images, it will
      test both regular and fault cases when 'resize on upload' has been
      ticked, as that option uses the PHP/GD library, just like the thumbnails
      do.</p>
